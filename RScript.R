# Look for distinctiveness greater than .5
# Look for widespreadness less than .25

# Must subset data for each species
# Go biome by biome, try to find out how widespread in each biome when the species occurs
# ggplot

# find max widespreadness across all biomes, find the biome where it's most common
# some species occurrence might just be incidental

### get list of species from each biome
#what's the biome a particular species is most common, and
